# Greetings to all investment enthusiast,

This is an Investment graph project where you will be given with investor's, fund's and holding's information and one can get the market value.
The market value can be decided from investor name or fund name. Considering the quantity of the holdings and market value for each holding, final market value for particular investor or holding will be calculated.
Here, the facility is provided to exclude particular holding or set of holding to get excluded while calculating final market value.
